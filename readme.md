# PWM Signal Generation Using 555 Timer
This project demonstrates the generation of a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal using a 555 Timer IC configured in astable mode. The circuit is designed to control the operation of a DC motor 
using a PWM signal, which allows for the adjustment of the motor's speed by varying the duty cycle of the signal.

## Circuit Description
The 555 Timer IC is a versatile component capable of generating a PWM signal when configured in astable mode. In this configuration, the 555 Timer continuously produces 
HIGH and LOW pulses, which can be used to drive a DC motor or other load.

### Components Used
* 1 x 555 Timer IC
* 2 x Diodes
* 1 x Resistor
* 1 x Rheostat (Potentiometer)
* 2 x Capacitors
* DC Motor
